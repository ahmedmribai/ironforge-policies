## 2. How We Use Information
- Provide core workout tracking, quests, and personalized recommendations.
- Authenticate users via Google Sign-In and maintain synced progress across devices.
- Process in-app purchases/subscriptions and manage entitlements.
- Send optional notifications (training reminders, quest updates).
- Analyze anonymized usage to improve stability and features.
- Detect and prevent abuse or violations of our Terms.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not sell personal data. We share information only with processors required to operate the App:
- **Supabase** for authentication, database storage, and analytics.
- **Google** for Sign-In and Firebase services (if configured).
- **RevenueCat** and **Google Play Billing** for purchases.
- **Unity Ads** for rewarded/Interstitial ads (if enabled in settings).
- **Expo/React Native services** for OTA updates, push notifications, and crash logging.

Each processor uses the data solely to provide its service to us and is bound by its own privacy terms.

## 4. Data Retention
We retain account and workout data as long as your account remains active. If you request deletion or remain inactive for more than 24 months, we may delete or anonymize your data.

## 5. Your Rights
You may:
1. Access or update profile details inside the App.
2. Request data export by emailing **ahmedmribai92@gmail.com**.
3. Request deletion by using the in-app account deletion flow or emailing us. Deletion removes account data from Supabase and revokes RevenueCat entitlements, subject to legal retention requirements.
4. Control ad tracking via your device privacy settings.

## 6. Security
Data is transmitted over HTTPS and stored in reputable cloud providers. We implement authentication, least-privilege access, and monitoring. However, no system is perfectly secure; use strong passwords and keep your device updated.

## 7. International Transfers
Data may be processed on servers located in the United States or other countries where Supabase, Google, or RevenueCat operate. By using the App, you consent to cross-border transfers as permitted by law.

## 8. Changes
We may update this policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. Updates will be posted within the App repo and distributed builds. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance.

## 9. Contact
